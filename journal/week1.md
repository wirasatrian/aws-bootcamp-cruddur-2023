# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Containerize Backend 

### Test it running on local environment

Before containerize, i'll make sure the backend app running on local environment without errors.
First, typing below commands to install the flask modules

```sh
  cd backend-flask
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Set this two Environment Variable

```sh
  export FRONTEND_URL='*'
  export BACKEND_URL='*'
```

Then running an app on port 4567

```sh
  python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
```
After running, click the PORT tab, click the address link whic port is 4567 and append this endpoint : /api/activities/home

When succesfull, there will be json output on browser screen

### Build Docker Image

The next step was build docker image from a Dockerfile, give it backend-flask with default latest tag

```sh
  docker build -t backend-flask .
```
Check the resulting image by typing this command

```sh
  docker images
```

### Run Container

Run container using image that was created before using these option :
```
  -p 5000:4567  => binding host port 5000 into container port 4567
  -name         => name the container a given name
  -d            => run container in background and print container ID (detach mode)
```
```sh
  docker run -p 5000:4567 -d --name backend-flask backend-flask
```
Cek and list the running container by this command

  ```sh
    docker ps
  ```

Try to test the running container using curl :

```
  curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/activities/home -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Ooppss! Type Error on terminal screen.

Show the logs using docker logs command

```
  docker logs backend-flask
```

The environment variable seems not set yet. Try to debug using docker exec command and check the environment variables.

```
  docker exec -it backend-flask bash
```

Stop and remove the container, re-run the command with additional option -e to set enviroment variables 

```sh
  docker stop backend-flask
  docker rm backend-flask
  docker run -p 5000:4567 -d --name backend-flask -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*'  backend-flask
```
Then test again. Success !
